NYC CITI bike Dataset is used for Visualization, Data cleaning with Pandas. Tableau Visualization Dashboard shows the following:

The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Displays the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. From the gr
aph we can observe that the checout time for most of the users is around the range of 0- 50 minutes with the maximum users checked out around time range of 0- 15 minutes

Visualization 4: Trips by Gender

<img width="891" alt="Screen Shot 2021-10-13 at 6 40 33 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57809798/137222320-cb21f67c-6328-41aa-9b84-deee0e10cf2e.png">

Shows the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap by each Gender. Comparing the heatmaps for male annd female, male group tends to be on the higher side of utilizing the bike rides

Visualization 5:User trips by Gender by Week Day

Shows the number of bike trips by gender for each hour for each day of the week as a heatmap. Comparing between subscribers and customers, subscribers tend to use the bike trip more often than the customers and again on the subscribers side male tend to use bike trips more often than female while male and female customers used almost the same level while comparing the customers

# Summary

The visualizations resulted in successful interpretation of Citi Bike rides dataset showing time that bikes are checked, the location, gender, and usertype. With the datasets we can visualize more data interpretaions with respect to bike id, end coordinates and other data dimension combinations
